# Roadmap



#### Note: Logging System for Compiler Diagnostics

With the ongoing development of the script compiler (and the player etc), 
relying solely on throw for error reporting might be insufficient for tracking the entire compilation process (e.g., the operation stack or non-critical warnings). 

A dedicated logging system may be considered in the future to provide better diagnostics.
