# @axi-engine/data

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@axi-engine/data.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axi-engine/data)

## Description

This package offers a compact yet robust solution for state management. 
Designed with minimal dependencies, it serves as a core component of the axi-engine 
but is also powerful enough to be used as a standalone library in any TypeScript project.

At its core, the library allows you to create, manage, and observe your application's state. 
The system is built around a tree-like hierarchy (FieldTree), where individual data points (Field) are reactive signals. 
This makes it the ideal central hub for all persistent data, such as player stats, inventory, quest flags, and more.

Please note that this package is under active development. 
The API, features, and documentation will be gradually expanded and improved.

## How to use


```bash
npm install @axi-engine/data
```
