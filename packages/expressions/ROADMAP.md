# Roadmap

### Complete Test Coverage:
  
Achieve high test coverage for all core logic, including every expression handler and edge case in `resolveOperand`. 
This is the top priority for ensuring stability.

### Syntactic Sugar Helpers:
  
Create a set of optional helper functions to simplify the creation of complex expressions in code. 
For example, a `between(value, min, max)` function that generates the corresponding `and` / `comparison` tree, etc.
