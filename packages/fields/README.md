# @axi-engine/fields

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@axi-engine/utils.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axi-engine/fields)


A hierarchical, reactive state management library for Axi Engine, built on top of Preact Signals.

## Description

This package provides the core logic for creating, 
managing, and observing the game state. 
It allows you to structure your data in a tree-like hierarchy (FieldTree),
where each piece of data (Field) is a reactive signal. 
This is the central hub for all persistent game data, such as player stats, inventory, quest flags, and more.



```bash
npm install @axi-engine/fields
```
